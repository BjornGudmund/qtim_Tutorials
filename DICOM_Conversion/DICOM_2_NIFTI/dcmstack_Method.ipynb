    "# Converting DICOM Files to NIfTI Format Using dcmstack \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach you how to convert DICOM files to Nifti format using the \"dcmstack\" Python package. DICOM is an effecient and flexible format for storing pixel data and metadata tags for medical images. Nifti is a another popular imaging format that is more limited than DICOM when it comes to metadata and segmentation features, but is well-supported in packages in Python ([nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/)), Matlab ([dicm2nii](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42997-dicom-to-nifti-converter--nifti-tool-and-viewer)), and R ([oro.nifti](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oro.nifti/oro.nifti.pdf)). [dcmstack](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi) is a Python library used to convert between the two.\n",
